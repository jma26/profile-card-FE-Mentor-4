## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

There were a couple CSS properties I learned more about! I did not know you could manipulate the background position to to achieve what I needed in the desktop, mobile-preview. In addition, I found out I've been relying a lot on `div` tags for layout instead of HTML5 semantics. I thought about the semantics and decided that I should be really using semantic tags like `article`, `header`.
